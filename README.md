# Bikesharing
Analyzing bikeshare data in NYC with Tableau.


## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was designed help clients see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for different cities. Completed a bike trip analysis to show the success in NYC and convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.


## Results
Using Tableau, I created seven visualizations to portray the data.

The visualization above shows a line graph of the number of riders broken down by hours and minutes of trip duration. As you can see, the highest number of riders happens within the first hour, between 0 and 20 minutes of that hour.

This visualization shows another line graph of the number of riders by hour and minute of trip duration, but now even more broken down by gender. As you can see from this graph, the highest number of riders seems to be male, with female as the lowest.

This visualization above is a heat map portraying the concentratin of stoptimes by week day and hour of start time. As you can see, the darkest parts are between 5 and 7 pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

The fourth visualization is another heat map of start times by weekdays and hours, but this time broken down by gender. Most of the dark spots seem to be with males, following the conclusion from the visual above.

The fifth visualization is a third heat map showing the concentration of riders for weekdays by gender, broken down by the user type of the bikers. The highest concentrations in the map are for the subscriber males, with the darkest blocks on Thursdays and Fridays.

The second to last visualization is a pie chart breaking down the number of riders for each gender. The highest percentage of riders are male, with the lowest percentage being female.

The last visualization breaks down the number of riders and their start times, specifically for the month of August. The highest number of riders seems to be during the times of 8 am and 5 pm.

## Summary
Completing this analysis and creating several visualizations helped show the varying data for bike-sharing in NYC. Thursdays showed to be the most popular day to ride, especially by male riders. The most popular ride start times showed between 5 pm - 7 pm, which is not surprising to me as that is a timeframe where people are returning home from work. The gender with the highest number of riders is male, which could be something to keep in mind for opening bike-sharing in another city. I believe there is sufficient evidence to convince our customer to open a bike-sharing program in another area, even with the data from one month. Two visualizations that I suggest for future analysis: number of riders and peak start/stop times for winter months (December, January, etc), and the average duration for riders for winter months broken down by genders. I believe that both of these visualizations could help clients look deeper into the popularity of bike-sharing in cities.
